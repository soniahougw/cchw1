I recreated Wassily Kandinsky’s Composition VIII, interpreting the triangles as mountains and transforming the blue area into an ocean. I titled my version “Ocean Sunset with Kandinsky." The interaction features include: * Moving the mouse to represent the sun, which also changes the background (sky) color. * Displaying the text “mouse located at: x, y” when the mouse is moving. * Pressing the ‘w’ key to generate waves. * Clicking Run to create falling snow in random positions each time.
